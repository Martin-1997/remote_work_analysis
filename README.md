# Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course. In this project, data from a StackOverFlow survey is analyzed to answer certain questions regarding remote work. The 3 key questions which are answered based on the data are the following:

- Is remote work also common for young professionals, or is it more common for more experienced employees?
- Is a smaller or a bigger company more likely to offer remote jobs?
- What are the most common ways for companies to search for remote workforce?

The CRISP-DM framework is used.
