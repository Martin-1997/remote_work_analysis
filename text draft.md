# A guideline for future remote employees

Working from home is on the rise - across all industries. With better, cheaper and more reliable digital communication technologies, many activities can be done from anywhere in the world.

Especially jobs related to information technology like system administration, software development or data science can be perfectly done without a office building. 

Despite concerns about remote work, like reduced organizational affiliation, reduced personal contact with colleagues and challenes related to digial meetings, the trend towards remote work with all its benefits is likely to further accelerate in the future.

The benefits for both emplooye and employer are overwhelming: Employees can save a lot of time they usually spend in traffic jams as well as costs for fuel or train tickets. Additionally, employees can work more flexible and can structure their day based on their own individual needs or responsibilities: For example, a father could prepare lunch for the children before they come home from school. Somewhere else, a young woman can easily practice some Yoga between her business meetings to sharpen her focus.

But remote work is not only a big advantage for employees -  also companies can benefit from a remote workforce: First, there is no need anymore for expensive office buildings including costs for heating, electricity, cleaning, office furniture etc. Moreover, happier employees with a good work-life-balance are more productive and do not waste time on stupid tasks to fill out the time at work. The trust provided by the company will be reciprocated by increasingly loyal employees who want the best for the company to further improve this win-win situation.

Especially in areas where much creativity is needed, the benefits of flexible remote work take an even larger effect.
